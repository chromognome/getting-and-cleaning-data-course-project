## **Getting and cleaning data course project**  

#### **Project overview**  

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The files included in this repository demonstrate my ability to perform the following steps to create a tidy data set: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

#### **Description of files**  

- `CodeBook.md` -- Describes the data, the variables, and the transformations used to clean up the data

- `run_analysis.R` -- This is the script used to perform the steps required by the project to create the tidy data set

- `tidy_data_summary.txt` -- The submitted tidy data set created in the fifth step
